## 5. Concerns about an uprising
How realistic is the idea that sentient AI can be specialized to the same extent as hardware? For instance, a watch cannot suddenly change into a smartphone, and similarly Robbie is programmed to be a nursemaid and some behaviors are therefore hard-coded into it's brain. Are fears of an AI uprising then exaggerated, given that specialized AI, even if sentient, could be limited to certain behavioral patterns that are conducive to it's job description?
