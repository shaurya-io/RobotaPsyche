## On the sufficacy of the Turing Test 

The Turing Test was proposed in an era where people were just beginning to imagine the full potential of AI and robots - and this led them to devise simplistic tests to determine the consciousness of AI. Not to take away from the genius of Alan Turing, but the Turing Test oversimplifies a few key factors.

1. The interrogator's level of familiarity with technology will be a key factor in the outcome of this rational game.

2. The interrogator's knowledge of psychology, as well as their critical thinking abilities in terms of real-time analysis of responses (not only surface-level like one of us would) will also impact the outcome of the game.

3. Furthermore, whether or not the interrogator is familiarized with the internal decision-making process of the AI is also a factor worth considering.

To this end, I believe that a Turing Test conducted by an individual who has a background in AI and psychology, and knows how the AI participating in the game makes its decisions, will be a far more challenging test - but the flipside is that an AI that beats this test will have a much stronger claim to consciousness than an AI that beats an average interrogator with no background. Just because we ourselves are conscious does not mean that all humans understand consciousness with the same degree of detail - just like the difference between an average person and a cardiologist even though both of them have hearts.

## On the distinction between "true" consciousness and the appearance of consciousness

One of the common arguments we hear around AI consciousness (and indeed the Turing Test also hinges upon this assertion somewhat) is that the appearance of consciounsess - one convincing enough to fool a "truly" conscious being such as a human, is enough for us to label an AI as conscious. 

I'm of the opinion that this is incorrect for several reasons.

### 1. The interrogator's competence matters. 

I briefly touched on this previously, but the TLDR is: it is easier to fool some people than others - which means oversimplistic tests such as Turing's offer a varying level of challenge based on the player roster. Not ideal.

### 2. The true test of consciousness cannot be external.

We know that human beings are conscious because we ourselves are, and everyone around us behaves in similar patterns - and therefore we induce it to the entire human population. We know that animals are conscious because they behave in similar rudimentary patterns (avoid pain, seek pleasure is one of them) and our theories based on an assumption around animal consciousnes generally pan out well. 

But truly, consciousness is a step forward compared to thinking - a conscious being is aware of its own existence. It is not clear to me how an external test can determine an AI's level of self-identity. There may be sophisticated programs that can simulate this for a human audience, yes, but I'd argue that that is not good enough to be labelled true consciousness unless we can prove, looking at the source code for instance, that the AI in question truly recognises it's own existence as a distinct entity.
