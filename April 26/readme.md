Here are some of my thoughts after the assigned reading:

1. How does one begin to approach the weakening/strengthening of the laws as depicted in the story, from a code perspective? To my understanding the intensity of the law's enforcement is a very philosophical concept.

2. Why do we think that Asimov concluded that a unified set of laws for all robots was a good idea - in that every robot from all his stories follows some basic variation of the 3 laws? It might make sense as a plot device, but as a realistic solution it leads to more and more conflicts in my opinion.

3. Nestor is depicted as an entity with feelings - but this is never explicitly acknowledged. It is easier for us to understand the source of robot feelings as compared to our own, because our brain's chemical circuitly is infinitely more complex than the robot's electronic circuitry. Do you think that simply because of their more complex origins, human emotions are more "real" than robot emotions?

4. It seems a little convenient that robots capable of complex emotions, including superiority complex, are not able to process commands like "Get Lost" in a figurative way. Even modern voice assistants know how to do this, and they seem quite far off from complex emotions. What other elements in Asimov's sci-fi stories can you point to that exist in contradiction with the way modern technology has progressed?
