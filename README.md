## On the Code vs Essay Choice
I for one have a predisposition to pick code projects when offered a choice - however, this semester I wish to make an exception to this because my other classes are quite code-heavy and will involve code projects as well. Given that situation, an essay provides a nice change of pace for my personal workflow while also ensuring that I cover this class's topics adequately.

For now, my preliminary idea is to conduct a deep analysis of General AI vs Narrow AI - and analysing the challenges + what it will take to develop the former.
