1. As more technically aware individuals than most, we can agree that isolated off-grid sentient robots that do not use the internet will be extremely hard - should the conversation around robots' rights factor in the idea that their mind would probably be in the cloud and not in their 'bodies'? [Altered Carbon]

2. Will the power-balance between humans and robots change given the pace at which technology develops? [Musk with Joe Rogan]

3. How relevant is the ability to suffer and derive pleasure - in determining the 'rights' ascribed to robots?

4. There is a possibility that multiple frontrunners in AI technology may emerge based on slightly differing approaches - similar to Siri vs Alexa, Android vs iOS, and so on. How does this impact the determination of rights for robots - assuming slight differences in sentient ability?

5. How important is it for AI to have physical bodies? Perhaps they could live in VR?
