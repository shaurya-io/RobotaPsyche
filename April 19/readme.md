# Discussion questions from Isaac Asimov's "Reason"

1. I find this story to be a bigger commentary on religion than AI - Cutie's disbelief of a wider reality (and allegience to the Master) is quite similar to humans' belief in God. In Sapiens, Harari makes an argument that our ability to believe in abstractions allows us to cooperate at levels that other animals don't - how does this play into Cutie's functioning?

2. Could robots be too good for us to reason with - much like chess?
